**************Knowledge Tracing Experiments

This repository contains implementations and experiments with two widely used knowledge tracing models: Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT).

===========================BKT==================================

For Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), we use the pyBKT
 package.

Please install the package following the instructions in the repo.

The notebook BKT-exp.ipynb can be run directly with the provided datasets.

===========================DKT==================================

For Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), we adopt and extend the implementation from ckyeungac/ADM2017
.
The following key files are included:

model.py
Defines the core recurrent neural network (RNN/LSTM) model used for DKT, including forward propagation and prediction logic.

utils.py
Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, batching sequences, evaluation metrics, and other helper routines.

load_data.py
Handles dataset loading and formatting, including conversion of student interaction logs into the input format required by DKT.

DKT_assistment.py
The main script to run DKT experiments on the Assistments dataset (or other datasets). This script ties together model definition, data loading, training, and evaluation.
